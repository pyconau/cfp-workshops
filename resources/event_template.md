Do you have a talk idea but you're not quite sure how to bring it to life? Perhaps you've built something cool, contributed something you're proud of, or you want to teach a topic you've been learning about!

​Giving a talk at [COMMUNITY NAME], or at PyCon AU 2026 is a great way to share your knowledge and tell your story!

​We know presenting a talk can be daunting, especially if its your first time speaking in public. It's also a hugely rewarding experience and a great way to build your professional profile in the industry.

### ​Session Outline
​This workshop will walk you through putting together a proposal, what is expected, what the PyCon AU program review committee is looking for. We will then spend some time helping you put together your talk.
